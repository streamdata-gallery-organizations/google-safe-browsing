  title: Google Safe Browsing
  description: The Safe Browsing API is an experimental API that allows client applications
    to check URLs against Google's constantly-updated blacklists of suspected phishing
    and malware pages. Your client application can use the API to download an encrypted
    table for local, client-side lookups of URLs.
